Learn c++ while remaking Paradroid

Welcome to a program dedicated to keeping the old Commodore 64 game - Paradroid alive.

This is a native port of the game, while learning C++, to Linux, and hopefully cross-platform to Windows.

The game uses the original sounds and some of the graphics from the C64 version.

I have tried to keep the gameplay the same as the original - including the strengh of the robots, and the transfer game.
