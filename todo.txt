BUGS
--------
BUG - Transfer screen one - shows player droid at wrong position on start

TO DO
-------

Calibrate joystick

Transfer - enemy AI - do based on priority of circuit types
Droid AI - Attack
Droid AI - Help
Check bottom edge of animated tiles in graphics
Stop droids from continually ramming when on a aStar path
Follow mode ? Droid follows exact tile path that player took? Array to store tile path? Use tiles as waypoints
 - player - track a breadcrumb trail -- do coordinates as tile coords.
 Hunt mode - when in attack mode, and lose sight, go into hunt - check current tile to see if it is one
 in the player trail or not, if so, follow to player - until attack timer runs out

Need debug mode to show path destination to track why aStar isn't working sometimes

Deck view - Player icon location wrong on observation, airlock

NOTES
-----------

Android
Use these hints:

SDL_SetHint(SDL_HINT_TOUCH_MOUSE_EVENTS, "0");
SDL_SetHint(SDL_HINT_ANDROID_SEPARATE_MOUSE_AND_TOUCH, "1");

Then multiply your touch events by window / renderer width & height and they should mirror mouse coordinates.
